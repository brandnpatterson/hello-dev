# Hello World

Development environment that preprocesses styles, bundles scripts, watches for file changes, and uses live reload

### Getting Started

Start by cloning this repo, then run

```
cd hello-world
```

then run

```
npm install
```

And run gulp's default task

```
gulp
```

You will see 'Hello World' open at localhost:3000

## Live Reload

As you change files in the `src` folder, you will see changes reflected in the browser.

### New Files
When adding new files, restart your server so that the new files will be watched

## Using a Proxy

1. To add a proxy to browser sync, first create the proxy on your local machine. Next replace the `server` property with the `proxy` property and define your proxy.

```
let localhost = 'hello-world.localhost';

browserSync.init({
    server: {
        // baseDir: './'
        proxy: localhost
    }
});
```

2. If using Apache, don't forget to add your new host to the hosts dir (likely /etc/hosts)
```
sudo nano hosts
```
```
127.0.0.1 hello-world.localhost
```
